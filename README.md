### 📝 Project Overview
This project analyzes Airbnb data from New York City to help investors and hosts understand market trends. I have used data analytics to find the best bedroom configurations and revenue hotspots.

### 🔍 Key Insights (What I Found)
1.  **Business Growth:** New host registrations peaked in 2014 but showed a decline in 2015.
2.  **Revenue Strategy:** Surprisingly, **2-Bedroom apartments** ($209 avg) generate more daily income than **3-Bedroom apartments** ($195 avg).
3.  **Real Demand:** By analyzing review conversion rates, I estimated that actual booking volumes are 2x-3x higher than the review counts.

### 🛠️ Tools Used
* **Microsoft Excel:** Pivot Tables, Data Cleaning, Custom Formulas.
* **Data Visualization:** Interactive Dashboard, Scenario Analysis Tables.
